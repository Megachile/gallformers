The galls on the latter are variable in shape, rounded or elongate. Each has a slender short stem or neck. The length varies from 1.5 to 5 mm. They are solitary and are usually crowded and numerous at the basal part of the leaf blade in the angles between the larger veins. The exterior of the galls appears wrinkled and glossy. They change from yellowish green or dark green to pink, to brown, to black. The interior is hollow, and the exit hole, which is on the underside of the leaf, is lined with unicellular whitish hairs. In heavy infestations, the leaves become curled, form cylindrical rolls, and drop prematurely. The galls on red maple differ in size and form. They are smaller, I to 2 mm, somewhat beadlike, and without a basal constriction or neck.

29,Vasates aceriscrumena,Vasates aceriscrumena,Vasates aceriscrumena,An Illustrated Guide to Plant Abnormalities Caused by Eriophyid Mites in North America,"Another common and abundant pouch gall that develops on the upper surface of sugar maple leaves is the spindle or finger gall, which is caused by Vasates aceriscrumena. The gall is distinguished from that of V. quadripedes Shimer by its form, position, color, and texture. The galls are solitary, elongate, with pointed or truncate apices, or spindle shaped. They are variable in size, up to 5 mm in length, and tend to crowd at the apical half of the leaf blade. They vary from greenish tinged with yellow to pink, to crimson. The exit hole on the underside of the leaf has a tuft of unicellular hairs, but the interior of the gall is thin walled and lacks hairs. 
Vasates aceriscrumena is similar to V. quadripedes. It is recognized by having two spinules on the anterior lobe of the dorsal shield, by the forward-centrad direction of the dorsal setae, and by the well pronounced design of the dorsal shield. 
Specimens are found in galls through July on sugar maple in the Eastern United States and Canada.

It consists of puckered, irregular, rounded, or wartlike pouches affecting both upper and lower surfaces of the leaves. The galls are usually scattered about indiscriminately on the leaf blade. They range from green to pinkish, to red brown. Poison oak leaves are often so heavily attacked that they become visibly crinkled and distorted. 
Specimens were collected on poison oak in Oregon and California and on poison ivy in Ohio and Maryland. It has also been found on poison sumac (Rhus vernix L.) in Ohio.

Flowers of large vines sometimes become deformed producing numerous long narrow filaments that are narrow rolled leaves; mites deveop in large numbers within the rolls; in some cases the filaments are somewhat more leaflike [West Virginia: Monongalia, Nicholas, Preston and Tucker counties; Maryland: near mouth of Susquehanna River]. Are these a different species?","Toxicodendron radicans,Toxicodendron diversilobum,Toxicodendron vernix",,,"Amrine & Stasny, 1994, erroneously listed this mite as nomen nudum. The mite described by Stebbins meets all code requirements for an older description: ""a name, a mention of the animal and a description of the work of the animal""; thus her name is valid and has priority over Ewing's toxicophagus. We hereby elevate her name, Eriophyes rhois Stebbins 1909 to the accepted name for the poison ivy ( Toxicodendron radicans) gall mite. Ewing's Phyllocoptes toxicophagus is valid and occurs on Toxicodendron diversilobum. The deutogyne of rhois was photographed by Briones & McDaniel, 1976, 41, f. 88 and was observed by J. Amrine, 2 Sep. 1998 on specimens collected from Monongalia Co. WV, Cobun Creek Trail, by pasture, south of Cobun Creek Rd, 1 Sep, 1998, ex poison ivy [Toxicodendron radicans]; they need to be described. The name rhois is a modified form of Rhus. Mites, if they occur on Toxicodendron pubescens Mill. (Atlantic Poison Ivy) and T. rydberghi (Small ex Rydb.) Greene (Western Poison Ivy) may all be separate, distinct species.  
Nalepa 1929 listed on p. 124, under Rhus radicans, Eriophyes rhois Stebbins 1909, and under Rhus diversilobus, Phyllocoptes toxicophagus Ewing, 1922; it may be that galls on each species of Rhus is caused by a different mite. Very careful morphological studies should be done, with rearing experiments and DNA studies. Probably, Aculops toxicophagus (Ewing) will be the name for the mite causing galls on Rhus diversiobus, and Aculops rhois (Stebbins, 1909) for the mite causing erineum galls on Rhus radicans.

NOTE: Inflorescences of Rhus radicans often have flowers & fruits formed into long foliar filaments, with the edges curled in toward the upper midrib, containing numerous mites and a few hairs. Much of this dries up during the season and becomes brown or black and brittle, resembling Spanish Moss on poison ivy. But, many deformations continue to have parts of the deformity growing, tender and green containing mites eggs and offspring even into November. Deutogynes in August were more common in older filaments; protogynes and developing mites in the tender growth. Deformed fruiting bodies have been found at cliffs at Blackwater Falls St. Park (Tucker Co., WV),at the Summersville Library on several large plants on three large trees (Nicholas Co.), at I-79 Rest Area N. Bound, north of Clarksburg, Harrison Co., WV, at Cheat Lake south of Mont Chateau (WV Geological Survey), at Cheat Lake, Morgan's Run Park and Trail, at Monongahela River, just south of the Morgantown Dam, east side along bike path, and at 24 Pinnacle Lane, Monongalia Co., WV. Originally, the foliated fruit was thought to be injury from glyphosate (A.I. of Roundup herbicide), but, symptoms have been found where pesticides have never been used. These mites are very similar to Aculops rhois and careful descriptions should be made to determine if one and the same species causes both kinds of deformities. It is not known if this symptom occurs on Poison Oak, Poison Sumac or other species of Rhus in North America. Examination of large hedgerows of poison ivy in New Orleans failed to find any of this new symptom. So far, it has only been found in several locations in West Virginia, in Bridgeport, Morgantown, Cooper's Rock State Forest, and Black Water St. Park in Tucker Co. ",,,,No

The mites occur among the fleshy tissue in the galls and presumably leave the galls and migrate to the buds during unfavorable weather. The host plant is locally known as chaparral broom, a spreading evergreen shrub that occurs in coastal and inland hills in California and southern Oregon. The mite specimens were first collected in California in April. Eriophyes baccharipha should not be confused with two other eriophyids that infest Baccharis in California. They are Eriophyes calibaccharis Keifer, which occurs in the terminal buds of chaparral broom, and E. baccharices (Keifer), which causes irregular, wartlike, rough-looking galls on the upper surface of the leaves of seep willow (Baccharis glutinosa Pers.) and mule-fat (B. viminea D.

They are found only on the largest leaves of the thriftiest shoots of young oaks. The clusters contain from one or two dozen galls up to a hundred or more, and extend along the vein two, three or even four inches. The vein is considerably enlarged, and is often split by the crowding of the galls as they increase in size. The blade of the leaf is often torn by the same force and the galls appear on both surfaces. When on the tree they are covered with a dense, coarse pubescence which is, in color, a dusky drab, or when exposed to the sun a brownish red. They are round except a very slight elongation at the point of attachment to the leaf. After falling to the ground they soon turn black, and after losing their pubescence they resemble quite closely small black pepper corns. At this time they are a solid mass of vegetable cells with a minute jelly-like center, which is the undeveloped larva. The growing larva devours the gall till at maturity nothing remains but a thin shell.

68,Disholcaspis bassetti,Disholcaspis bassetti,Disholcaspis bassetti,A Study of the Cynipidae,"The gall occurs, sometimes singly, but usually in clusters about the twigs. The cluster represented at Fig. 2 was composed of 30 of these galls closely crowded together. The galls resemble very much the galls of Holcaspis duricoria Bass (Cynips mamma Wal) (Fig 3). The galls are very much the shape that a thick waxy material would take if dropped on the twigs and then suddenly congealed, leaved stout, test-like projections standing out from each drop. The central cell is placed low in the gall and can usually be seen protruding when the latter is broken off. Some entomologists have thought this gall to be identical with Walsh's C. mamma, but I have examined a large number of both forms and find the following points of difference, which convince me that this, if not a new species, is certainly a well marked variety:
H bassetti as compared with H duricoria, is rather larger and more irregular in outline. The teat-like projection is much heavier and longer in proportion to the size of the gall and appears to be a drawn-out portion of the substance of the gall, while in duricoria it is a small, hard pointed projection much resembling a spine in many cases, and often almost entirely wanting. In bassetti the substance of the gall is more corky and easy to cut. The central cell, as before stated, is at the base of the gall, and when the latter is removed the point of the cell can usually be seen protruding below. Before the gall is detached the central cell is situated with its greatest diameter perpendicular to the limb at the point of attachment of the gall. In duricoria the cell is situated at the center of the gall; it never protrudes from below when the gall is detached; and it always has its greatest diameter parallel with the limb at the point of attachment of the gall. The central or larval cells are also differently shaped. In duricoria the cell is egg-shaped, while in bassetti the end towards the twig is somewhat pointed, so that the cell is very much the shape of a plump apple seed with the point rounded off.

Each gall monothalamous, elongate, rather cylindrical, urn-shape, broadest at the middle, less broad apically, flattened at the end, taper pointed basally, up to 4 mm in diameter by 6 mm in length; colored dark green when young, becoming a dark red or purplish red when old. Mostly solid and fleshy when young, becoming hard, thin -walled, and hollow when old, without a distinct larval cell lining. In compact clusters of up to 30 galls, attached to the midrib, on the under sides of leaves of Quercus stellata (and Q breviloba?)
This gall is very common on the post oaks in Texas. Patterson states that the punctures from which the galls will arise may be detected about the first of May, that the galls do not develop from the scars until about the middle of July, that the galls are fully grown in size by the first of October, and in a couple of weeks most of them fall to the ground. I have collected them in late November and December, but the larva are then still so small that they do not mature after becoming dry. Evidently they need to be kept moist, as they are when lying on the ground, to allow the insect to develop. Patterson secured over a hundred adults which emerged from February 12, 1922, to March 8. Inasmuch as the breeding of the insect is difficult unless carefully handled on the field, we are considerably indebted to Dr. Patterson for successfully rearing the adult. I collected the galls, but did not obtain the insects from the other Texas localities listed. It is possible but not prob-able that other varieties occur at some of those points. The gall occurs on Q. breviloba at Leander, and Patterson reports it as occasionally on breviloba at Austin. It is not unlikely that the breviloba insect is a distinct variety with a range centering about Burnett County, Texas.

Amer. Ent. Soc., XXXIX, p. 245) from galls taken by Weld at Evanston, Illinois, on Q. macromrpa. Similar galls have been recorded and are common on white oaks of many species from the whole of eastern United States. Unfortunately I cannot examine the types of dimorphus, and cannot furnish a comparative description. Probably several different varieties occur in several faunal areas, and possibly different varieties on different hosts. This variety appears to differ from dimorphus in having the thorax less roughly rugose, the parapsidal grooves and lateral lines smooth, and the first abscissa of the radius not infuscated. Probably an examination of the dimorphus type would modify this comparison and disclose other points of difference. 
Cynips vacciniiformis was described from Q. stellata galls which are undoubtedly those of verifactor, and from Austin. But the description of the single insect obtained is far from correct for the true producer of this gall, and apparently applies to a different species mistakenly supposed to have come from verifactor galls. Vaccinliformis was described in 1913. Of course insects bred from galls collected in 1917 and now labelled cotypes in at least a couple of collections, cannot have any standing as type material.

From a certain number of the galls emerge, by the middle of June, both male and female gall flies. These have been named by Osten Sacken, Cynips (Amphibolips) spongifica. The gall-flies which emerge in October or the following spring are all agamous females, and have been named Cynips confluens by Harris. I have examined the type of confluens in the Boston Society of Natural History, and find it to be identical with Amphibolips aciculata Osten Sacken. Amphibolips coccinea occurs on the scarlet oak, and is the same as spongifica, which is found on the red oak (Quercus rubra) and quercitron oak (Quercus velutina). According to Walsh, A confluens (=aciculata) is the dimorphic female of A spongifica. He informs us that by the fore part or middle of June both male and female gall-flies of A spongifica eat their way out of a certain percentage of galls while the larvae of others lie dormant for more than two months, when they change into pupae state, and subsequently about October eat their way out in the form of gall-flies known as Amphibolips confluens. Out of thousands of these autumnal flies examined by Walsh, all were females with not a single male among them. He has experimentally ascertained, by colonizing a number of these females upon isolated black oaks (Q velutina) known to be not previously infested with oak-apples, that they cause galls to be generated in the following spring upon such isolated black oaks.

From a certain number of the galls emerge, by the middle of June, both male and female gall flies. These have been named by Osten Sacken, Cynips (Amphibolips) spongifica. The gall-flies which emerge in October or the following spring are all agamous females, and have been named Cynips confluens by Harris. I have examined the type of confluens in the Boston Society of Natural History, and find it to be identical with Amphibolips aciculata Osten Sacken. Amphibolips coccinea occurs on the scarlet oak, and is the same as spongifica, which is found on the red oak (Quercus rubra) and quercitron oak (Quercus velutina). According to Walsh, A confluens (=aciculata) is the dimorphic female of A spongifica. He informs us that by the fore part or middle of June both male and female gall-flies of A spongifica eat their way out of a certain percentage of galls while the larvae of others lie dormant for more than two months, when they change into pupae state, and subsequently about October eat their way out in the form of gall-flies known as Amphibolips confluens. Out of thousands of these autumnal flies examined by Walsh, all were females with not a single male among them. He has experimentally ascertained, by colonizing a number of these females upon isolated black oaks (Q velutina) known to be not previously infested with oak-apples, that they cause galls to be generated in the following spring upon such isolated black oaks. From galls produced in this manner, Walsh succeeded in breeding two specimens of the spring form of gall-flies (A spongifica), which exists in both sexes, and five specimens of the autumnal form (A confluens), which exists exclusively in the female sex. Finally, he treated these five autumnal specimens in the same manner, i.e., placing them upon another isolated black oak, and obtained galls in the following spring which produced two specimens of the spring form (spongifica), proving that the autumnal form sooner or later reverts to the spring form.",,"May, June","Canada, New England, Middle States, GA, CO",No

Globular to prolate spheroidal in shape and invariably terminating in a minute point. The thick walled larval cell at the centre of the gall is surrounded by a sponge-like mass of fibres that is at first white but becomes dark brown when the gall is dry. At a very early stage of development the epidermis of the gall is pubescent but later it becomes smooth. The colour is at first green but this changes to a lustrous light brown when the gall is old. Dimensions:—Average diameter 4o mm. 
(a) Stage in which the gall is 2 mm. in diameter. Almost the entire gall consists of a compact tissue, which is composed of small uniform cells. Lines of narrow elongated cells, however, pass in a radial direction throughout this tissue. These cells do not extend into the gall cavity nor out to the epidermis, they traverse about two-thirds of the gall radius. As they approach the epidermis the lines curve around and run parallel to its surface. Spiral vessels are in some cases differentiated in these rays and the elements are more numerous near the point of attachment of the gall. 
(b) Older stage 9 mm. in diameter. The gall wall can now be divided roughly into three sections. That part lying next the larval cell resembles closely the compact tissue described in the preceding stage, except that immediately adjoining the cavity a typical nutritive layer has been formed by the elongation of the cells in a radial direction. In the centre zone the lines of cells containing the vessels are much more apparent at this stage, since the intervening tissue has become loose and skeleton-like. The cells composing it are long, very narrow and frequently branched. In many cases a branch is attached to the main cell without the formation of an intersecting partition between the two. The outside zone of the three is composed of somewhat elliptical cells. These form a fairly firm tissue constituting the rind of the gall. 
(c) Mature stage. The protective zone is now the most characteristic feature of the anatomical structure. The part of the protective sheath adjoining the larval cavity consists of a few layers of elliptical cells arranged in tangential rows. The sclerenchymatous deposits on the outside walls of these cells are much heavier than those on the inside. Further out the protective cells are formed in radial rows and their walls are uniformly thickened. This protective strengthening of the cell walls extends even into the loosely arranged filament-like cells, some of which are heavily sclerified.

In all the three cases, the gall is the prolongation of a vein; in the latter case, the vein, in consequence of the growth of the leaf, has become entirely independent of the blade and appears to be growing out of the leaf-stalk.
