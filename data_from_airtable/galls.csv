It consists of puckered, irregular, rounded, or wartlike pouches affecting both upper and lower surfaces of the leaves. The galls are usually scattered about indiscriminately on the leaf blade. They range from green to pinkish, to red brown. Poison oak leaves are often so heavily attacked that they become visibly crinkled and distorted. 
Specimens were collected on poison oak in Oregon and California and on poison ivy in Ohio and Maryland. It has also been found on poison sumac (Rhus vernix L.) in Ohio.

Are these a different species?","11C, 11A , 11B, 11D","Amrine & Stasny, 1994, erroneously listed this mite as nomen nudum. The mite described by Stebbins meets all code requirements for an older description: ""a name, a mention of the animal and a description of the work of the animal""; thus her name is valid and has priority over Ewing's toxicophagus. We hereby elevate her name, Eriophyes rhois Stebbins 1909 to the accepted name for the poison ivy ( Toxicodendron radicans) gall mite. Ewing's Phyllocoptes toxicophagus is valid and occurs on Toxicodendron diversilobum. The deutogyne of rhois was photographed by Briones & McDaniel, 1976, 41, f. 88 and was observed by J. Amrine, 2 Sep. 1998 on specimens collected from Monongalia Co. WV, Cobun Creek Trail, by pasture, south of Cobun Creek Rd, 1 Sep, 1998, ex poison ivy [Toxicodendron radicans]; they need to be described. The name rhois is a modified form of Rhus. Mites, if they occur on Toxicodendron pubescens Mill. (Atlantic Poison Ivy) and T. rydberghi (Small ex Rydb.) Greene (Western Poison Ivy) may all be separate, distinct species.  
Nalepa 1929 listed on p. 124, under Rhus radicans, Eriophyes rhois Stebbins 1909, and under Rhus diversilobus, Phyllocoptes toxicophagus Ewing, 1922; it may be that galls on each species of Rhus is caused by a different mite. Very careful morphological studies should be done, with rearing experiments and DNA studies. Probably, Aculops toxicophagus (Ewing) will be the name for the mite causing galls on Rhus diversiobus, and Aculops rhois (Stebbins, 1909) for the mite causing erineum galls on Rhus radicans.

NOTE: Inflorescences of Rhus radicans often have flowers & fruits formed into long foliar filaments, with the edges curled in toward the upper midrib, containing numerous mites and a few hairs. Much of this dries up during the season and becomes brown or black and brittle, resembling Spanish Moss on poison ivy. But, many deformations continue to have parts of the deformity growing, tender and green containing mites eggs and offspring even into November. Deutogynes in August were more common in older filaments; protogynes and developing mites in the tender growth. Deformed fruiting bodies have been found at cliffs at Blackwater Falls St. Park (Tucker Co., WV),at the Summersville Library on several large plants on three large trees (Nicholas Co.), at I-79 Rest Area N. Bound, north of Clarksburg, Harrison Co., WV, at Cheat Lake south of Mont Chateau (WV Geological Survey), at Cheat Lake, Morgan's Run Park and Trail, at Monongahela River, just south of the Morgantown Dam, east side along bike path, and at 24 Pinnacle Lane, Monongalia Co., WV. Originally, the foliated fruit was thought to be injury from glyphosate (A.I. of Roundup herbicide), but, symptoms have been found where pesticides have never been used. These mites are very similar to Aculops rhois and careful descriptions should be made to determine if one and the same species causes both kinds of deformities. It is not known if this symptom occurs on Poison Oak, Poison Sumac or other species of Rhus in North America. Examination of large hedgerows of poison ivy in New Orleans failed to find any of this new symptom. So far, it has only been found in several locations in West Virginia, in Bridgeport, Morgantown, Cooper's Rock State Forest, and Black Water St. Park in Tucker Co.

The vein is considerably enlarged, and is often split by the crowding of the galls as they increase in size.

When on the tree they are covered with a dense, coarse pubescence which is, in color, a dusky drab, or when exposed to the sun a brownish red. They are round except a very slight elongation at the point of attachment to the leaf. After falling to the ground they soon turn black, and after losing their pubescence they resemble quite closely small black pepper corns. At this time they are a solid mass of vegetable cells with a minute jelly-like center, which is the undeveloped larva.

The cluster represented at Fig. 2 was composed of 30 of these galls closely crowded together. The galls resemble very much the galls of Holcaspis duricoria Bass (Cynips mamma Wal) (Fig 3). The galls are very much the shape that a thick waxy material would take if dropped on the twigs and then suddenly congealed, leaved stout, test-like projections standing out from each drop. The central cell is placed low in the gall and can usually be seen protruding when the latter is broken off. Some entomologists have thought this gall to be identical with Walsh's C. mamma, but I have examined a large number of both forms and find the following points of difference, which convince me that this, if not a new species, is certainly a well marked variety:
H bassetti as compared with H duricoria, is rather larger and more irregular in outline. The teat-like projection is much heavier and longer in proportion to the size of the gall and appears to be a drawn-out portion of the substance of the gall, while in duricoria it is a small, hard pointed projection much resembling a spine in many cases, and often almost entirely wanting. In bassetti the substance of the gall is more corky and easy to cut. The central cell, as before stated, is at the base of the gall, and when the latter is removed the point of the cell can usually be seen protruding below. Before the gall is detached the central cell is situated with its greatest diameter perpendicular to the limb at the point of attachment of the gall. In duricoria the cell is situated at the center of the gall; it never protrudes from below when the gall is detached; and it always has its greatest diameter parallel with the limb at the point of attachment of the gall. The central or larval cells are also differently shaped. In duricoria the cell is egg-shaped, while in bassetti the end towards the twig is somewhat pointed, so that the cell is very much the shape of a plump apple seed with the point rounded off. , A monothalamous gall occurring singly or in clusters around the stems of the host. When grouped the galls often cover completely 4 to 5 inches of the stem.
When the gall is not deformed by crowding, it is irregularly circular in outline at the base, gradually tapering to a distinct point that is recurved in most cases. The gall is attached to the host by a small stalk at the centre of the base. Colour green, often tinged with pink when young; becoming brown when more mature. The larval chamber resembles closely that found in the former species [Disholcaspis quercusglobulus] in being oval and free at maturity, but it differs in being placed nearer the base of the gall and in tapering to a point at the end nearer the twig. 
Diameter at base, average, 16 mm.

Monothalamous. Green, sometimes tinged with red. Elongate, rounded at the sides, narrow at the point of attachment and concave at the apex with a small central nipple. Outside it is rather densely covered with small pustules. When young, the gall is almost solid, but as it grows older the larval chamber gradually occupies the entire interior. After it drops to the ground, late in the fall, the gall gradually changes its shape to almost globular (berry-like) with the concave apex flattened and the surrounding rim less prominent. The crystal-like pustules change, the gall becoming evenly rugose. The point of attachment becomes long, narrow, and sharply pointed. The entire inside becomes hollow with the outer wall thin and brittle. Length 2.5 to 5 mm, width 2 to 4 mm, length of clusters 5 to 35 mm., These galls occur as midrib clusters on under side of leaves of Quercus stellata in the fall, dropping when mature. When fresh the individual galls are shaped like huckleberry flowers, somewhat cylindrical with the end distinctly truncate and depressed, but during the winter on the ground they become globular except for a short pedical, and the depressed end becomes a flattened circular scar at apex with a slightly raised rim, and the greenish or reddish color changes to brown., Clustered, seed-like leaf galls. Each gall monothalamous, elongate, rather cylindrical, urn-shape, broadest at the middle, less broad apically, flattened at the end, taper pointed basally, up to 4 mm in diameter by 6 mm in length; colored dark green when young, becoming a dark red or purplish red when old. Mostly solid and fleshy when young, becoming hard, thin -walled, and hollow when old, without a distinct larval cell lining. In compact clusters of up to 30 galls, attached to the midrib, on the under sides of leaves of Quercus stellata (and Q breviloba?)
This gall is very common on the post oaks in Texas. Patterson states that the punctures from which the galls will arise may be detected about the first of May, that the galls do not develop from the scars until about the middle of July, that the galls are fully grown in size by the first of October, and in a couple of weeks most of them fall to the ground. I have collected them in late November and December, but the larva are then still so small that they do not mature after becoming dry. Evidently they need to be kept moist, as they are when lying on the ground, to allow the insect to develop. Patterson secured over a hundred adults which emerged from February 12, 1922, to March 8. Inasmuch as the breeding of the insect is difficult unless carefully handled on the field, we are considerably indebted to Dr. Patterson for successfully rearing the adult. I collected the galls, but did not obtain the insects from the other Texas localities listed. It is possible but not prob-able that other varieties occur at some of those points. The gall occurs on Q. breviloba at Leander, and Patterson reports it as occasionally on breviloba at Austin. It is not unlikely that the breviloba insect is a distinct variety with a range centering about Burnett County, Texas.

At first I considered it to be that of Zopheroteras vaccinii Ashm., which it resembles when immature. But the flies are different, the female of vaccinii being apterous. The gall of A. impositus when mature resembles somewhat those of Cynips dimorphus and C. vacciniiformis. My galls were collected during September and until November 1st, 1915, but they evidently also occur earlier in the season, because some of the flies emerged in June and July and others in September, 1916. But the majority remained over until 19t7, the flies emerging indoors in January and February. My specimens were collected on a small rocky elevation in a, swamp, close to the Bronx River. near Westchester, New York City. This locality is gradually being filled in for streets and other improvement and soon %%rill become extinct. I have also taken the gall at Lakehurst, New Jersey, and it probably will be found in other places where Quercus minor [stellata] grows. 
, Lustrans was described from two adults captured at Austin, TX, gall and host unknown. One of these specimens was given in 1921 to the writer, who recognized its close relation to impositus. lustrans is described as without a median groove, but this specimen in certain positions shows a faint median line, while the groove in some of the many available partaypes of impositus is fully as faintly defined. The writer is unable to separate paratypes of verifactor from lustrans. The gall of this species was first described by Osten Sacken in 1862, but Ashmead was evidently in error in thinking he had reared it in 1887, associating the wingless fly he reared with the wrong gall. , This is certainly a variety of Andricus dimorphus, described as a Cynips (Beutenmuller, 1913, Trans. Amer. Ent. Soc., XXXIX, p. 245) from galls taken by Weld at Evanston, Illinois, on Q. macromrpa. Similar galls have been recorded and are common on white oaks of many species from the whole of eastern United States. Unfortunately I cannot examine the types of dimorphus, and cannot furnish a comparative description. Probably several different varieties occur in several faunal areas, and possibly different varieties on different hosts. This variety appears to differ from dimorphus in having the thorax less roughly rugose, the parapsidal grooves and lateral lines smooth, and the first abscissa of the radius not infuscated. Probably an examination of the dimorphus type would modify this comparison and disclose other points of difference. 
Cynips vacciniiformis was described from Q. stellata galls which are undoubtedly those of verifactor, and from Austin. But the description of the single insect obtained is far from correct for the true producer of this gall, and apparently applies to a different species mistakenly supposed to have come from verifactor galls. Vaccinliformis was described in 1913. Of course insects bred from galls collected in 1917 and now labelled cotypes in at least a couple of collections, cannot have any standing as type material.

This well-known gall is very common and hundreds may often be found upon a single tree. It makes its appearance early in may, as soon as the leaves put forth, on different kinds of oaks belonging to the red oak group, and is fully grown in a few weeks. It is popularly known as ""oak-apple"" or May-apple, owing to its superficial resemblance to a small apple. , Attached to the midrib near the base of a leaf and prevents its development beyond the point of attachment.

The gall very much resembles that of Amphibolips longicornis., Allied to A spongifica, and probably found in similar situations on the leaves and young twigs of oak.

It is an inch and a half long and an inch and a quarter thick. Species of oak unknown., The galls belong to the oak-apple family, and much resemble those of A spongifica OS and A coccinae OS, but the surface is more coarsely reticulated and less glossy, and internally the spongy mass surrounding the larval cell is of a much darker color. The shell is also much thinner, and, in my dried specimens, is irregularly shrunken and depressed, until they look like pressed figs. I am not sure as to the species of oak on which they grew, but the few immature leaves that came with the galls seem to be those of Q obtusiloba [Quercus stellata--a mistaken guess]. The galls are attached to the midvein near the base of the leaf and prevent its development beyond the point of attachment; they are as large as those of A spongifica, and differ widely from A cinerea described by Mr. Ashmead., Globular leaf gall resembling that of A confluens, form spongifica, and A cinerea, but the surface is more coarsely reticulated and less glossy and the larval cell much darker in color, diameter 2.5 cm on midrib near base of leaf on Q ?minor [Quercus stellata; incorrect], Quercus rubra. Red Oak. Large, smooth, globular gall on the leaves, filled, when ripe, with a brown, spongy mass. Diameter about 1.5.These galls are more than one inch, sometimes almost two inches in diameter. ""They are green and somewhat pulpy at first, says Dr. Harris, but when ripe, they consist of a thin and brittle shell, of a dirty drab color, enclosing a quantity of brown, spongy matter in the middle of which is a woody kernel about as big as a pea. A single grub live sin the kernel, becomes a chrysalis in the autumn, when the oak-apple falls from the tree, changes to a fly in the spring and makes its escape out of a small round hole which it gnaws through the kernel and shell. This is probably the usual course, but I have known the fly to come out in October.""I am more inclined to agree with Dr Fitch who supposes that there are annually two generations of this fly. They are not rare around Washington, but I have never found them so abundantly as they seem to occur in other localities. On the first of June I found balls of this kind already ripened, measuring one inch and a half in diameter, of the usual drab color and somewhat greenish only at its base. One of them, which I opened contained a larva. On the 13th of June another gall was opened, it contained the perfect insect, but with wings yet wet and folded and evidently not quite ready to escape. , The external appearance of this gall is very like that of the gall of C. q. inanis. It is more or less globular (although irregular specimens of both frequently occur), that is, not narrowed towards the basis; its surface is glossy. Internally, it is easily distinguished by the spongy mass which fills it. It seems to reach a larger size than the former gall, as among six specimens now before me, one measures an inch and a half in diameter and two others are but little smaller, whereas among eight specimens of the gall of C q inanis the largest does not much exceed an inch. From the following gall [Cynips quercus spongifica] it is distinguished by its glossy surface, its less dense and more whitish spongy internal matter, its much thinner and brittle shell and by its shape, which is more rounded on the top. , Quercus tinctoria [velutina]. Black Oak. Large, round gall, somewhat attenuated and pointed at the top; surface more or less opaque, as if powdered or dusted; shell thick, inside, a dense, spongy, brownish substance, surrounding the kernel. Diameter about an inch and a half. 
On the 25th of May last I found four full-grown specimens of this gall on the leaves of a large black oak and have obtained, on June 15, three female specimens of the gall-fly. They look exactly like C. q. inanis, only they are a little larger (the gall also being larger). . . Of these galls three, taken from a high branch of the tree, can be considered as typical specimens. They are slightly oblong, that is, somewhat extended into a point at the end, although not narrowed at the basis. Their diameter is about an inch and a half. Their color is drab, sometimes spotted with brown on one side; the surface is more or less opaque, as if powdered or sericeous, and shows very little gloss. The shell is much thicker than that of the two previous species [Cynips quercus coccineae and Cynips quercus inanis]; the spongy mass is more dense and brownish.
A fourth specimen, found on the same tree, is more irregular in its shape; its surface is without any gloss and altogether drab, without brown spots. Specimens of this kind are frequently found on young shrubs of Q tinctoria [velutina], the leaves of which are very rusty-puberelent beneath., The Fibrous Oak-apple. Amphibolips coccineae. There are several large, spherical galls, common on oaks, which have received the name of oak-apples. These galls resemble each other quite closely in their external appearance, but differ much in their internal structure. The one which we name the Fibrous Oak-apple is represented by Figure 746. In the centre of the gall there is a small, hollow kernel, in the cavity of which the gall-fly is developed. The space between this kernel and the dense outer layer of the gall is filled with many fibres, which radiate from the kernel. This gall is found on the scarlet oak, and varies in size from three fourths inch to two inches in diameter., The Spongy Oak-apple, is most common on red oak, but it occurs also on the black oak. In this gall the space between the kernel and the outer layer is quite densely filled with a porous mass, which suggests the name spongy., Large spongy oak apple. Galls appear with the leaves in spring, becoming 40 mm in diameter, green until full grown early in May, turning brown about the time the flies, males and females, emerge the latter half of June. On Q velutina., A globular gall found attached to leaf by small portion. Monothalamous; larval cell surrounded by brown spongy mass, and that by a rather smooth thickened wall. Pale green and soft while fresh, turning brown and brittle. 2-4 cm in diameter. Common on black, red, and scarlet oaks. Begins growth about May. Males and females emerge in June. Some females remain until October (C aciculata OS) A good example of dimorphism., Leaf-gall, globular, suppressing part or all of leaf, at first green, soon becoming light brown, with shiny, paper wall, containing a spongy mass of radiating fibres covered with down, which hold in place the oblong central larval chamber. 3-5 cm in diameter.

From a certain number of the galls emerge, by the middle of June, both male and female gall flies. These have been named by Osten Sacken, Cynips (Amphibolips) spongifica. The gall-flies which emerge in October or the following spring are all agamous females, and have been named Cynips confluens by Harris. I have examined the type of confluens in the Boston Society of Natural History, and find it to be identical with Amphibolips aciculata Osten Sacken. Amphibolips coccinea occurs on the scarlet oak, and is the same as spongifica, which is found on the red oak (Quercus rubra) and quercitron oak (Quercus velutina). According to Walsh, A confluens (=aciculata) is the dimorphic female of A spongifica. He informs us that by the fore part or middle of June both male and female gall-flies of A spongifica eat their way out of a certain percentage of galls while the larvae of others lie dormant for more than two months, when they change into pupae state, and subsequently about October eat their way out in the form of gall-flies known as Amphibolips confluens. Out of thousands of these autumnal flies examined by Walsh, all were females with not a single male among them. He has experimentally ascertained, by colonizing a number of these females upon isolated black oaks (Q velutina) known to be not previously infested with oak-apples, that they cause galls to be generated in the following spring upon such isolated black oaks. From galls produced in this manner, Walsh succeeded in breeding two specimens of the spring form of gall-flies (A spongifica), which exists in both sexes, and five specimens of the autumnal form (A confluens), which exists exclusively in the female sex. Finally, he treated these five autumnal specimens in the same manner, i.e., placing them upon another isolated black oak, and obtained galls in the following spring which produced two specimens of the spring form (spongifica), proving that the autumnal form sooner or later reverts to the spring form., [According to Bassett, Osten Sacken was mistaken to think this was the same as Harris' Cynips confluens, and the description he gives here is in fact the original description of Bassett's Amphibolips confluens form spongifica], [Osten Sacken here retracts his assertion that his ""Cynips confluens"" was synonymous with Harris's C confluens, and synonymizes his Cynips confluens with his new C q coccineae]
From this gall I have obtained this year (about the 25th of June) only one female specimen, not showing any perceptible difference from C q. inanis, except that the thorax is somewhat reddish, which is probably due to the immaturity of the specimen., This is the opaque variety mentioned [in the original Osten Sacken 1861 paper ""On the Cynipidae of the North American Oaks and their Galls""] under the head of Cynips confluens. , [A coccineae is listed as a synonym of A quercusspongifica by Beutenmuller and Krombein but this description seems to match A quercusinanis instead], This insect shows an alternation of generations, hence the long list of synonyms.","The species of Amphibolips and their gall,The species of Amphibolips and their gall,The species of Amphibolips and their gall,Key to American Insect Galls,New Species of North American Cynipidae (1900),New Species of North American Cynipidae (1890),Key to American Insect Galls,On the Cynipidae of the North American Oaks and their Galls,""Additions and corrections to the paper entitled """"On the Cynipidae of the North American Oaks and their Galls"""""",""Additions and corrections to the paper entitled """"On the Cynipidae of the North American Oaks and their Galls"""""",A manual for the study of insects,A manual for the study of insects,Cynipid Galls of the Chicago Area,""Insect galls of Springfield, Massachusetts, and vicinity"",Insect galls of Cedar Point and vicinity,Cynipid galls of the eastern United States",,,,,

They grow on the leaves of the red oak, are round and smooth, and measure from an inch and a half to two inches in diameter. This kind of gall is green and somewhat pulpy at first, but, when ripe, it consists of a thin and brittle shell, of a dirty drab color, enclosing a quantity of brown spongy matter, in the middle of which is a woody kernel about as big as a pea. A single grub lives in the kernel, becomes a chrysalis in the autumn, when the oak-apple falls from the tree, changes to a fly in the spring, and makes its escape out of a small round hole which it gnaws through the kernel and shell. This is probably the usual course, but I have known this gall-fly to come out in October. , Globular, smooth, shining or opaque leaf gall, internally a juicy, white, spongy substance and a large central larval cell, green, turning with age to light brown, diameter 2.5 to 5 cm, usually on a vein or petiole, on Q rubra, Q coccinea, and Q velutina in May and June., Quercus tinctoria [velutina].

Diameter upwards to an inch and a half. 
The specimens . . . can be distinguished at once from the gall of C q spongifica, by their smooth, glossy surface and their subglobular or short-oval form, their basis being slightly attenuated, their top, on the contrary, being broad and rounded. Otherwise, their thick shell and their dense, brownish spongy substance reminds of C q spongifica. , Similar [to Amphibolips spongifica] but the adults, all females, emerge in Nov. Probably an alternating generation of the above but the life history needs further study., A monothalamous gall attached to the petiole or midrib of the leaf. The midrib is never continued beyond the point of origin of the gall.
Globular to prolate spheroidal in shape and invariably terminating in a minute point. The thick walled larval cell at the centre of the gall is surrounded by a sponge-like mass of fibres that is at first white but becomes dark brown when the gall is dry. At a very early stage of development the epidermis of the gall is pubescent but later it becomes smooth. The colour is at first green but this changes to a lustrous light brown when the gall is old. Dimensions:—Average diameter 4o mm. 
(a) Stage in which the gall is 2 mm. in diameter. Almost the entire gall consists of a compact tissue, which is composed of small uniform cells. Lines of narrow elongated cells, however, pass in a radial direction throughout this tissue. These cells do not extend into the gall cavity nor out to the epidermis, they traverse about two-thirds of the gall radius. As they approach the epidermis the lines curve around and run parallel to its surface. Spiral vessels are in some cases differentiated in these rays and the elements are more numerous near the point of attachment of the gall. 
(b) Older stage 9 mm. in diameter. The gall wall can now be divided roughly into three sections. That part lying next the larval cell resembles closely the compact tissue described in the preceding stage, except that immediately adjoining the cavity a typical nutritive layer has been formed by the elongation of the cells in a radial direction. In the centre zone the lines of cells containing the vessels are much more apparent at this stage, since the intervening tissue has become loose and skeleton-like. The cells composing it are long, very narrow and frequently branched. In many cases a branch is attached to the main cell without the formation of an intersecting partition between the two. The outside zone of the three is composed of somewhat elliptical cells. These form a fairly firm tissue constituting the rind of the gall. 
(c) Mature stage. The protective zone is now the most characteristic feature of the anatomical structure. The part of the protective sheath adjoining the larval cavity consists of a few layers of elliptical cells arranged in tangential rows. The sclerenchymatous deposits on the outside walls of these cells are much heavier than those on the inside. Further out the protective cells are formed in radial rows and their walls are uniformly thickened. This protective strengthening of the cell walls extends even into the loosely arranged filament-like cells, some of which are heavily sclerified.
, Thin walled and globular, about 4 cm in diameter. Exterior surface smooth (not pubescent) and somewhat irregular. Interior filled with a spongy mass of fibres, very loosely attached to the exterior but tightly attached to an interior woody cell in which the larva lives. Green in the early part of the season, later turning brown and brittle. Generally produced on the upper part of the leaf from the end of one of the veins. Occurs on Red Oak and other closely related species. Common., This is one of our common oak galls. It is nearly globular in shape, greenish or brown in color dependent on its age, and its interior is filled with a spongy mass in the center of which is a single larval cell. This species is occasionally quite abundant on trees, as may be seen by reference to plate 50, figure 1, though it cannot be considered injurious. [The figure in Felt's plate seems to be what we would now call Amphibolips quercusinanis], Large, globular, more or less smooth outside and filled with a spongy substance in the center of which is a hard woody kernel containing the larval cell. From 1 to 2 in in diameter. When fresh, it is pale green, soft and succulent, with the contents whitish. Later in the season the shell becomes brown, hard and brittle, with the kernel woody and the spongy substance dark brown, but remaining soft. Confined to the leaves of the trees belonging to the red oak group. Common., The Large Oak Apple gall, occurs from southern Canada to Virginia. It produces galls on the leaves or leaf petioles of various oaks, principally red, black, and scarlet. These galls are quite large, from 12 to 50 mm in diameter, and greenish to brownish in color, depending on age., The mature insects are small, gall wasps which appear early in the spring; the eggs are laid in the tissues of the leaves or the petioles. The globose galls are 0.5 to 2 inches in diameter and are conspicuous. As they develop, they change from green to brown.

From a certain number of the galls emerge, by the middle of June, both male and female gall flies. These have been named by Osten Sacken, Cynips (Amphibolips) spongifica. The gall-flies which emerge in October or the following spring are all agamous females, and have been named Cynips confluens by Harris. I have examined the type of confluens in the Boston Society of Natural History, and find it to be identical with Amphibolips aciculata Osten Sacken. Amphibolips coccinea occurs on the scarlet oak, and is the same as spongifica, which is found on the red oak (Quercus rubra) and quercitron oak (Quercus velutina). According to Walsh, A confluens (=aciculata) is the dimorphic female of A spongifica. He informs us that by the fore part or middle of June both male and female gall-flies of A spongifica eat their way out of a certain percentage of galls while the larvae of others lie dormant for more than two months, when they change into pupae state, and subsequently about October eat their way out in the form of gall-flies known as Amphibolips confluens. Out of thousands of these autumnal flies examined by Walsh, all were females with not a single male among them. He has experimentally ascertained, by colonizing a number of these females upon isolated black oaks (Q velutina) known to be not previously infested with oak-apples, that they cause galls to be generated in the following spring upon such isolated black oaks. From galls produced in this manner, Walsh succeeded in breeding two specimens of the spring form of gall-flies (A spongifica), which exists in both sexes, and five specimens of the autumnal form (A confluens), which exists exclusively in the female sex. Finally, he treated these five autumnal specimens in the same manner, i.e., placing them upon another isolated black oak, and obtained galls in the following spring which produced two specimens of the spring form (spongifica), proving that the autumnal form sooner or later reverts to the spring form., I received from Mr Benj D Walsh in Rock Island IL two specimens of a gall-fly, which he reared abundantly from a gall answering exactly Dr. Harris's description of the gall C confluens. He took these specimens for the true C confluens, in which I cannot agree with him. . . . It seems to be therefore a different kind of gall, very like the preceeding [C confluens], but producing a very different insect., (Syn C confluens Harris?)
The synonymy of this species with C confluens Harris, supposed by Mr Walsh, is founded on the occurrence of their galls at the same season, and on the statement of Mr. Norton about the agreement of C q aciculata with the original specimens of C confluens in Dr Harris' collection. But if Dr Harris' gall-fly really lives on the red oak, its great resemblance to C q aciculata, occurring on the black oak, would be no more a proof of their identity, than the great resemblance of C q inanis and spongifica is of theirs. The two latter gall-flies, although almost perfectly similar in appearance, occur on different oaks and produce quite different galls. It may be that the true C confluens Harris, although closely resembling C q aciculata, produces on the red oak a gall, sufficiently different from that of the other species, to be distinguished by constant characters. The synonymy of both therefore, although probably, seems to require further confirmation., Walsh supported the idea about alternate generations in Amphibolips confluens, but no direct experiments were carried out.
In some cases, studies on life cycles were taken by some specialists with scepticism, as in the case of Walsh's studies on Amphibolips confluens in United States. 
Table 2: Agamic form: Amphibolips confluenta (Harris) Sexual form: known, not named ?, Mr Beutenmuller states that a certain number of these galls produce both males and females in June and others females in October or the following spring. These latter are merely a dimorphic form., Walsh had reported in great detail the discovery of two very different forms of adults, one agamic and the other bisexual, emerging at different times of the year from very similar if not identical galls of Amphibolips confluens. The work was undoubtedly exact as far it went and, if it covers the complete life cycle of the species, it furnishes the first completed record of alternation. But Walsh, though he attempted to control the insects by confining them in nets placed on the trees, was unable to discover oviposition and it is not yet satisfactorily shown that the complete life cycle of the species has been discovered.","""A Report on the Insects of Massachusetts, Injurious to Vegetation"",Key to American Insect Galls,The species of Amphibolips and their gall,On the Cynipidae of the North American Oaks and their Galls,""Additions and corrections to the paper entitled """"On the Cynipidae of the North American Oaks and their Galls"""""",Cynipid Galls of the Chicago Area,""Current state of knowledge of heterogony in Cynipidae (Hymenoptera, Cynipoidea)"",A contribution to the morphology and biology of insect galls ,Insect Galls of Ontario,Insects affecting park and woodland trees,A catalogue of the gall insects of Ontario,Insect-galls of the vicinity of New York City,Life histories of American Cynipidae,Eastern forest insects,""Identification of hardwood insects by type of tree injury, North-Central Region"",A manual for the study of insects,Cynipid galls of the eastern United States",,,,,

Red oak. Large, smooth, globular brownish-yellow gall, attached to the underside of the leaves, inside with whitish, delicate filaments radiating from the kernel to the shell. Diam about an inch.
Very like gall No. 1 [Cynips confluens] at first glance, but smaller, the specimens in my possession measuring an inch or a little more in diameter. It is also fastened to the leaf by a small point on its surface. The outside of this gall shows no other difference from the oak-apple of the red oak but the size. The inside on the contrary distinguishes them at once; instead of the spongy, brown mass with which the other gall is filled, this one is almost empty, the kernel being kept in its central position by a certain number of whitish filaments which radiate from it to the shell. , Q coccinea. Scarlet oak? Large, more or less round gall, not attenuated towards the basis; surface glossy; shell thin and brittle; on the inside whitish filaments radiating from the kernel to the shell. Diameter about an inch.
Among the specimens of my collection, I find a number of galls, collected in one locality and somewhat different in shape from the typical specimens of C q inanis. The latter are more or less globular, the leaf being, so to say, the tangent of the globe. There is no distinct point or nipple on the top. The other gall, on the contrary, is somewhat lemon-shaped, being attenuated at its basis with a corresponding elongation, ending in a minute nipple, at the opposite end. Its color is more brownish than that of C q inanis; on the inside, I did not detect any difference between both galls. The tree is also either the red or the scarlet oak. , The Larger Empty Oak-apple. There are two oak apples which are very similar in structure, and which may be termed the empty oak apples. In these the space between the central kernel and the outer shell contains only a few, very slender, silky filaments, which hold the kernel in place. The larger of these two galls measures an inch or more in diameter, and is found on the scarlet oak and the red oak., This is a spherical gall with thin walls from which many fibers extend towards the center, these holding in place the cell in which the larva develops. The gall is between 15 and 30 mm in diameter, light yellow-green changing to light brown. Common on leaves of scarlet and red oak. Matures in june., Resembles the preceding species [A confluenta] in external appearance and in its attachment to the midrib or the petiole of the leaf. In shape it is more nearly spherical than A. confluens Harr. and it has a much thinner rind than is found in that species. The epidermis of the gall, which is at first green with dark spots, becomes light brown with darker patches at a later stage. The larval cell in this case is held in position by a number of fine radiating fibres. Dimensions:—Average diameter 35 mm. In the earlier stages the anatomical structure of this gall is practically the same as A. confluens Harr. The vascular strands surrounded by elongated cells are present, but as the gall becomes older the connecting tissue from between the strands disappears. In the mature gall the protective zone is very apparent. It consists of 8 to to rows of comparatively small elliptical cells. The walls of these cells are uniformly thickened, constituting a porous sclerenchyma. ",,"My attention has been called by Mr Walso to the fact that this gall has been erroneously taken by Dr Fitch for confluens Harris. Judging from some expressions in Dr Fitch's description, it may really be so. In this case, the insect described by Dr Fitch as C confluens would be a new species, very like the former; for which I propose the name of Cynips quercus inanis (Syn C confluens Fitch, non Harris). In the same case, I would be much inclined to think that my C quercus coelebs is the male, not of C confluens, but of C q inanis.","On the Cynipidae of the North American Oaks and their Galls,""Additions and corrections to the paper entitled """"On the Cynipidae of the North American Oaks and their Galls"""""",A manual for the study of insects,""Insect galls of Springfield, Massachusetts, and vicinity"",A contribution to the morphology and biology of insect galls ",,,,,
